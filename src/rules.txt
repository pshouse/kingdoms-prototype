***CORE ASSUPMTIONS***
A character can be involved only in one
intrigue at a time and can benefit only from the
effects of one party sheet at a time.

ORGANIZATION
An organization is a domain built around the
officers who founded it—the player characters. 

DOMAIN
A domain is described 
by its collection of skills, defenses, domain
powers, and domain features, as well as its size.

SKILLS
Diplomacy, Espionage, Lore, Operations

DEFENSES
Communications, Resolve, Resources

DOMAIN POWERS
Each domain also grants its officers access to special domain powers they can use in combat. Each
officer gets a power die that they roll at the beginning of any combat against one or more officers of
an opposed domain. The roll goes into a power
pool shared by all the officers of a domain, with
these dice fueling each character’s domain powers.

FEATURES
Every domain also provides a number of unique
domain features that officers can make use of
during intrigue, allowing the domain to affect the
opposed domain’s defenses and units, to muster special units, and make other preparations for battle.

SIZE
Each domain has a size that determines
how many turns it can take during intrigue, how
large its officers’ power dice are, and the scope of
certain benefits available to the domain’s army

INTRIGUE
Any domain skill that requires
targeting a villainous realm (including its agents,
libraries, and lands) should start intrigue.
